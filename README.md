  <summary><b>✨&nbsp;&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me</b></summary>
  <br/>
  
  Hi again! I am a 4th year physics student at Middle East Technical University in Ankara in Turkey. I also minor in logic and philosophy of science from the philosophy department at my university. I strive to be a data analyst, and I have been trying to learn the necessary tools for several months. I have started this journey from the Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate in Coursera, and after finishing it I have been trying to improve on the tools that I learned by completing case studies. Since childhood, I had a passion in finding patterns and combining seemingly unrevelant topics and this is also the way I am looking at new datasets: new puzzles to find more patterns. 
  
  Besides data analytics and physics, It can be said that I have a wide interest that encompasses almost anything related to human and nature. I like listening classical music and play my humble violin, and hope to be better at it someday. I have also an unending desire to learn languages as it is way to knowledge, and I am learning Latin for 2 years. As Horace said in Epistles 'Dimidium facti, qui coepit, habet: sapere aude, incipe. (He who has begun is half done: dare to know, begin!)'

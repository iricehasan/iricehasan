  <summary><b>✨&nbsp;&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me</b></summary>
  <br/>
  
  Hi again! I am a 4th year physics student at Middle East Technical University in Ankara in Turkey. I also minor in logic and philosophy of science from the philosophy department at my university and I am a junior blockchain engineer at a startup called Selenian Network. Beforehand, I have started my career journey from the Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate in Coursera, and after finishing it I have been trying to write SQL queries for data analysis. Discovering the transparency of on-chain data, I wrote some SQL queries on Dune and then I have been trying to learn Rust and CosmWasm for two months to write smart contracts in the Cosmos Ecosystem. 
  
  Besides data analytics and physics, It can be said that I have a wide interest that encompasses almost anything related to human and nature. I like listening classical music and play my humble violin, and hope to be better at it someday. I have also an unending desire to learn languages as it is way to knowledge, and I have been learning Latin for 2 years. As Horace said in Epistles 'Dimidium facti, qui coepit, habet: sapere aude, incipe. (He who has begun is half done: dare to know, begin!)'
